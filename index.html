  <h2> Where/What is Waianae, Hawaii? </h2>
  <img id ="waianaecoast" src="waianae_coast.jpg" alt ="coastline">
  <p> Waianae is a town located on the west coast of the island of O`ahu. This side of the island is referred to as the leeward coast. The leeward coast receives less rainfall than the east (or windward) side of Oahu. This is why Waianae has less greenery than other parts of O`ahu. It takes about 1 hour to drive from the city of Honolulu to Waianae. This is one of the reasons why Waianae schools are more difficult to staff.
